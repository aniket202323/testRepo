              </li>
              <li>
                All reports are now presented in PopUp controls instead of
                directly on the page. This allows users to ask the same report
                with different parameters faster.
              </li>
              <li>
                Report parameters are now all visible at once. The Tab control

                associated to Tasks, no longer Users.
              </li>

                Team/Routes hierarchy. The report can now be asked by Plant
                Model, by Route or by Team. Furthermore, in Team selection, we
                have the possibility to select Team/Plant Model and/or
                Team/Routes. It could give a total of 3 grids on the report.

              <li>
                Tasks Selection was modified to reflect the new Team/Routes
                structure. Users now have a list of Team(s) or Route(s) when
                selecting My Teams or My Routes option. But only Team(s) the
                user is member of will be displayed, as well as Route(s) member
                of their respective Team(s).
              </li>
              <li>
                Administration menu was modified. Route-Users screen is no
                longer available. Team-Routes screen was added in Teams
                Administration.
              </li>
              <li>
                When saving a Route or a Team, all leading and trailing blanks
                are removed to avoid duplicate description with only blank
                spaces as difference.
              </li>
              <li>
                A user can now be member of several teams. A flag is still
                indicating that the user is member of another team, but it will
                no longer be removed automatically from the other team as
                before.

                options are now only in the future (Tomorrow, Next Week, Next
                Month, Next 30 Days, etc‚Ä¶). If User-Defined time option is
